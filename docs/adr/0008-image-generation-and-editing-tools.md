# Image generation and editing (fast path + LLM tools)

## Status

accepted - all three phases (A, B, C) implemented under JUN-171.

Landed ahead of the phases: **image generation is now metered** (this PR). It
runs through a `june_services::ImageService` (authorize hold -> generate ->
charge, mirroring the web tools), priced per model by a dedicated `image_pricing`
map in `june-config` kept separate from the text/ASR catalog so image models
never leak into the served pickers. An unpriced model is rejected
`model_not_priced` (422); an out-of-credits user gets 402 before Venice is
called. Prices (Venice per-image cost x ~2, `$1 = 1000 credits`):
`venice-sd35` 20, `flux-dev` 20, `qwen-image` 60, `hidream` 40. **Editing**
metering ships with the `/image/edit` endpoint in Phase C.

Implemented since (JUN-171):

- **Phase A** — the `/image` fast-path image is held per session and lazily
  attached to the user's next message via the existing `image.attach_bytes`
  path, so a follow-up reaches the model with the image in context.
- **Phase B** — a `june_image` MCP server (`generate_image`) POSTs through the
  loopback proxy to `/v1/image/generate` (the proxy injects the selected image
  model + safe-mode setting); tool-result image content renders inline by
  reusing `AgentChatImagePart`.
- **Phase C** — `edit_image` is backed by a new `POST /v1/image/edit`
  endpoint + `VeniceImageEditor` provider (base64 in, **raw-binary** response
  re-encoded to base64) + `ImageEditRequest` domain type, metered on
  `ActionSlug::ImageEdit` with its own `image_edit_pricing` map
  (`firered-image-edit` 80) and default edit model. The MCP writes generated /
  edited images to a dedicated images dir so a returned `filename` can be
  threaded back into `edit_image`.
- **safe_mode** — Venice safe mode is a Settings toggle, **default off**
  (privacy-first). It flows end to end as `Option<bool>` (absent = Venice
  default), so older app builds calling the endpoints are unaffected.

## Addendum - 2026-07-03

Phase C has landed. The current built-in fallback image generation price list is
`venice-sd35` 20, `flux-2-pro` 60, `qwen-image` 60, and `chroma` 20 credits per
image. Image editing is metered separately through `image_edit_pricing`, with
`firered-image-edit` priced at 80 credits per image edit.

## Addendum - 2026-07-06

The Settings image-model picker now mirrors Venice's current image catalog for
models June can price, including privacy tags (`Private` or `Anonymized`) and an
`Uncensored` tag when Venice marks the model that way. `image_pricing` remains
the backend allowlist for generated image models; newly exposed models are priced
with the same flat ~2x convention as the original list. Models that Venice prices
by resolution use the default 1K tier until June exposes resolution controls.

## Addendum - 2026-07-06 (JUN-209: safe mode on by default + consent dialog)

Supersedes the **safe_mode** bullet above: the toggle now defaults **on**,
and a stored value is only honored when the user actually chose it. Any
settings save serializes the whole struct, so files written by pre-JUN-209
builds pin an explicit `false` the user never picked (reproduced on dev
machines days after JUN-171 landed). A serde-default flip alone would miss
those files, so the load path coerces: unless the persisted
`image_safe_mode_set_by_user` marker is true, `image_safe_mode` reads `true`
regardless of the stored value. The marker is set only by
`set_image_safe_mode` (the Settings toggle and the consent dialog); users
who deliberately opted out before the marker existed get flipped back on
once and can opt out again.

With a filtering default, the user needs an explicit, informed way out.
June adds a **safe-mode consent dialog**, gated by an on-device keyword
heuristic (`image_safety::may_request_explicit_content`) so benign prompts
never see it:

- `/image` flow: shown *before* the billable request. "Keep safe mode on"
  proceeds (pinned `safeMode: true`); "Turn off safe mode" persists the
  toggle off and proceeds unfiltered - that persisted toggle is the
  remembered preference.
- Agent tool path: the loopback proxy cannot block a tool call on user input,
  so it emits a best-effort `image-safe-mode-consent` Tauri event and the
  generation proceeds blurred; the dialog then offers to turn safe mode off
  for *future* images. The tool call is never delayed, altered, or failed by
  consent.
- "Don't ask again" persists `image_safe_mode_prompt_dismissed`. Explicitly
  re-enabling safe mode resets it, so re-opting into safety re-arms the
  dialog.

The dialog gate works differently per surface:

- Agent tool path: **free**. The model is already in the loop (it is the one
  calling the tool), so it self-classifies via a required `may_be_explicit`
  boolean on `generate_image`/`edit_image`. The proxy ORs that self-report
  with the on-device wordlist to decide the consent event, and strips the
  field before forwarding upstream. Self-report is filled by the very model
  the user is steering, so it can under-report - the failure mode is bounded
  exactly like a wordlist miss: no dialog, and Venice `safe_mode` still
  enforces the blur.
- `/image` fast path: wordlist first, then a **model check**. The on-device
  wordlist (`image_safety::may_request_explicit_content`) short-circuits the
  obvious cases for free; when it is silent AND safe mode is on AND the
  consent prompt is not dismissed, June asks the user's text model whether
  the prompt requests explicit content (a one-shot temperature-0 YES/NO
  chat completion through the same June API path as agent session titles,
  metered as a normal agent-chat call). Classifier failure or timeout falls
  back to the wordlist verdict; the check can delay but never block or fail
  a generation. Originally this surface was wordlist-only, but the wordlist
  is English-only and a Polish prompt reproduced the systematic miss
  (blurred result, no consent offer) - a model check is the only
  language-agnostic gate available on a path with no model in the loop.
  Accepted trade-offs, decided with the user: a small metered call per
  flagged-state generation, ~1-3s added latency before the dialog, and the
  prompt travels to June API for screening BEFORE consent whenever safe
  mode is on (it previously left the device only on actual generation).

Trade-offs accepted: the heuristic is a conservative wordlist (misses
euphemisms, some false positives) - acceptable because it only gates the
dialog; Venice `safe_mode` remains the enforcement, and a false negative just
means a blurred image with no offer. The wire shape is unchanged
(`Option<bool>`, absent = Venice default), so older app builds are
unaffected.

## Addendum - 2026-07-07 (edit sources for attached images)

`edit_image` now accepts a second source kind: the plain filename of an image
the user attached or pasted into the conversation. The Hermes runtime saves
attachments as `upload_*.png` into the same images directory the `june_image`
MCP uses, but the original edit contract required an HMAC-signed reference
minted only for `june_image` tool results - so the agent could not edit
attached images at all and fell back to vision-analyze + regenerate, which
the SOUL forbids and which double-charges when it works.

Security shape: bare filenames get NO new power. They are accepted only when
they are a plain name (no path separators) with the attachment prefix
(`upload_*`), carry a known image extension, and canonicalize inside the
canonicalized images root (symlink escapes rejected), then go through the
same size cap and content sniffing as signed references. Hermes can already
read and write that directory directly, so this widens nothing; tool-output
files (`generated-image-*`) still require a signed reference, keeping their
content-hash binding.

## Context

JUN-129 shipped `/image <prompt>` as a client-side slash command: it creates a
session and renders the generated image in-thread (loader -> image -> view /
download) without calling the LLM. The image lives only in a client-side overlay
and is imported to the session workspace, but it never enters the session
*history the model reads*. So a follow-up like "do you think it's nice?" reaches
the model with an empty context, and the model cannot generate or edit images on
its own from natural language.

Desired behavior:

1. Explicit `/image` on a new session stays a fast, no-LLM shot.
2. A follow-up that references the image must find it in the model's context.
3. Natural-language requests ("draw me a cat", "make it fluffier") should drive
   image generation/editing as a first-class LLM tool, so it is conversational
   and iterable.

Architecture facts established while designing:

- **Hermes is an external Python agent runtime.** June exposes tools to the LLM
  via stdlib-only Python **MCP servers embedded in `src-tauri`**
  (`src-tauri/src/hermes/june_web_mcp.py`, `june_context_mcp.py`), synced to disk
  and registered with Hermes. Each is a thin stdio JSON-RPC server that POSTs to
  the June app's loopback provider proxy, which forwards to **June API**. Adding
  an image tool follows this exact pattern with **no external Hermes changes**.
- MCP `tools/call` results can carry image content natively, so a tool-produced
  image is a session message the model reads — context and iteration for free.
- **June API** already has `POST /v1/image/generate` (text-to-image; base64 in an
  `images[]` response; authenticated, **not metered** yet).
- **Venice supports editing** via `POST /api/v1/image/edit` (image edit/inpaint):
  input `image` as base64/URL + `prompt`, a **separate** set of edit models
  (default `firered-image-edit`), and a **raw binary** response (not the base64
  envelope `/image/generate` returns). So editing needs a *new* June API provider
  path, not a tweak to the existing generator.
- The model cannot pass image bytes as a tool argument (it only *sees* an image
  via vision). An edit therefore must reference the image by a stable **filename**
  the generate tool returned; the MCP tool reads those bytes from the session
  workspace.

## Decision

1. **Hybrid, not either/or.** Keep the `/image` fast path (no LLM) *and* add LLM
   image tools. The fast path stays instant for the explicit first shot; the tool
   path handles model-driven generation and iteration.

2. **Fast-path image enters context by lazy attach.** After a fast-path
   generation the image is held (silently — no composer chip, since it already
   renders in-thread) and attached to the user's *next* message via the existing
   `image.attach_bytes` + `prompt.submit` path. It enters history exactly when the
   model first needs it and then persists. This avoids relying on unverified
   "attach with no following prompt" runtime semantics.

3. **Two MCP tools** in a new `june_image` MCP server:
   - `generate_image(prompt)` -> renders + returns `{ image, filename }`.
   - `edit_image(source_filename, instruction)` -> reads `source_filename` from the
     workspace, edits it, returns `{ image, filename }`.
   Distinct schemas make the model's choice explicit (no source = generate; a
   required `source` = edit) and force the model to name a real prior image.

4. **Image edit via a new June API endpoint.** `POST /v1/image/edit` backed by a new
   `VeniceImageEditor` provider (base64 input, binary response) and an
   `ImageEditRequest` domain type, with its own default edit model. Edit models
   are a separate catalog from generation models.

5. **Tool-produced images render in-thread by reusing `AgentChatImagePart`** (the
   part added for the fast path), extended to cover tool-result images.

## Consequences

Phased so each phase ships value on its own:

- **Phase A - fast-path context (small, no backend).** Lazy-attach the fast-path
  image to the next user message. Directly fixes the "empty context" follow-up
  gap and unblocks tool-driven iteration on a `/image` shot.
- **Phase B - `generate_image` tool (medium).** New `june_image_mcp.py` +
  registration in `hermes_bridge.rs` (script const, sync, config render, system
  prompt line), backed by the existing `/v1/image/generate`. Render tool-result
  images inline.
- **Phase C - `edit_image` + image edit backend (large).** New `/v1/image/edit`
  endpoint + `VeniceImageEditor` provider + `ImageEditRequest` domain type +
  edit-model default/setting + the `edit_image` tool.

Trade-offs and risks:

- Two generation paths (fast + tool) must stay consistent in render, model
  selection, and billing. **Generation is metered** as of this PR (see Status);
  the tool path (Phase B) reuses the same `/v1/image/generate` and so is metered
  for free. **Editing** (Phase C) meters when its `/v1/image/edit` endpoint lands
  — edit models are a separate price catalog.
- The model must correctly thread a returned `filename` back into `edit_image`;
  the tool descriptions must make this contract explicit.
- **Non-vision chat models** can't "see" an attached image; the existing
  `unsupportedImageInputPrompt` path-in-prompt fallback applies, so iteration is
  degraded (prompt-only) on those models.
- Edit models (`firered-image-edit`, `nano-banana-*-edit`, `gpt-image-*-edit`, …)
  are a separate catalog needing their own default and, eventually, a settings
  picker alongside the existing Image generation model.

## Addendum - 2026-07-03 (post-review hardening: billing retries and edit-source capabilities)

PR #584 shipped phases A-C and then went through 12 adversarial review rounds.
Three design decisions came out of them that this ADR did not anticipate;
recorded here because each is load-bearing and none is obvious from the code
alone.

**1. Charge keys are unique per attempt; retry dedupe is a separate ledger.**
Every settled generation/edit charges under a fresh UUID v7 operation id.
Charge keys are deliberately NEVER derived from the client `requestId`: a
requestId-derived key lets a replayed id run fresh Venice work while OS
Accounts dedupes the settlement as a replay - free images (review round 3).
Retry safety comes instead from an in-process request ledger keyed
user + requestId + request shape: settled entries replay the stored output
without touching Venice or the wallet; concurrent duplicates coalesce; a
post-provider charge failure parks the output with a stable settlement key
(charge-pending) and a retry re-charges that same key rather than re-running
the provider. Entries expire (settled: 10 min / capped; pending: the hold TTL)
and eviction is per-user with waiter notification.

**Accepted boundary:** the ledger is per-process. A retry that crosses a June
API restart, an eviction, or an instance switch can re-run the provider and
settle a duplicate flat charge. Durable request state is issue #613; until
then this is a documented residual risk, bounded by the client's short retry
window and flat 20-80 credit prices. Do not "fix" it by reusing requestId as
the charge key - that reopens the round-3 bypass.

**2. Timeout ordering is a config invariant.** The image upstream client
timeout sits below the route timeout with a settlement margin, and the image
hold TTL sits above the request timeout (`request_timeout_secs` + 30);
`june-config` validation rejects violations. Post-provider settlement runs on
a spawned task so an outer route timeout cannot cancel between Venice success
and the charge. Clients (desktop command and MCP) mint ONE requestId per
logical turn, pin the request shape (model, safe mode) at turn creation, and
replay transport failures plus 429/503/504 with the identical payload.

**3. Edit sources are host-minted capability refs.** `edit_image` accepts only
opaque refs the Rust loopback proxy minted when returning a generated/edited
image: an HMAC over filename + content hash, keyed by a secret stored in app
data outside Hermes home (the Seatbelt profile denies runtime reads). The
Python MCP holds no secret and reads no source bytes. Consequence: the runtime
cannot mint or retarget refs (overwriting a stored file invalidates its ref),
and user-uploaded attachments are NOT tool-path edit sources - Hermes provides
no per-call session identity to MCP servers, so a conversation-scoped
allow-list is impossible on this transport. Restoring attachment editing needs
a session-identity mechanism first (recorded as a PR followup).

## Addendum - 2026-07-23 (native path attachment snapshots)

Supersedes the Phase A transport detail above. June's desktop composer no
longer reads an image into a base64 data URL and sends it through both the
Tauri IPC bridge and Hermes WebSocket. Before `image.attach`, Rust now
canonicalizes the source, rejects symbolic links and hidden or sensitive
paths, requires the file to be under the Hermes workspace or a generated-image
directory, enforces the existing 50 MB cap, and retains an open source handle.
It then hardlinks the image when the filesystem permits, otherwise copies from
that validated handle, into a session-scoped directory under the Hermes
workspace. The runtime session id is hashed before it contributes to the
directory name.

The frontend passes only the prepared path to Hermes through `image.attach`.
`image.attach_bytes` remains an additive wire-compatible fallback for callers
that cannot provide a gateway-local path. Preview thumbnail generation stays a
separate bounded operation and is not reused as model input. A rejected native
path does not silently downgrade to the byte fallback because doing so would
bypass Rust's path-validation boundary.
