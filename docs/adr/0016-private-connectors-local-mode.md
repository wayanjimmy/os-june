# Private connectors (local mode): token custody, app-proxied MCP, trust modes

## Status

proposed - implements Phases 1-2 of
[private-connectors-prd.md](../private-connectors-prd.md) and
[private-connectors-implementation-plan.md](../private-connectors-implementation-plan.md).
Local mode only. Away-mode relay (Phase 3) and Slack/Notion/Linear (Phase 4)
are deliberately out of scope and will supersede parts of this ADR with their
own records.

## Context

June is adding Google connectors (Gmail + Calendar) so routines can act on the
user's real mail and calendar. The product promise is "private by
architecture, not policy": OpenSoftware must hold no credential that can read a
user's mail, even under compulsion. That promise is only true if three things
hold, and this ADR records how each is enforced in code, because each has a
tempting shortcut that breaks the promise.

The embedded Hermes runtime already ships a `google-workspace` skill upstream,
but it is unusable for this product: it requires the user to stand up their own
Google Cloud project, it stores the OAuth token as plaintext JSON inside the
agent's own working directory, it requests a broad scope superset in one
consent, and it drives Google through shell commands, which June's sandboxed
routines strip and which give no per-tool gate. We build a first-party path
instead.

Three runtime facts about the pinned Hermes (v0.17.0, commit `2bd1977d`) shape
the design and are load-bearing:

1. **Each MCP server is its own toolset** (`mcp-<server>`, with the raw server
   name as an alias). A routine's `enabled_toolsets` therefore decides, per
   server, whether the model can see those tools at all.
2. **Regular MCP tool calls bypass Hermes's approval layer entirely.** Only
   shell/exec/secret guards and server-initiated elicitation raise
   `approval.request`. Cron sessions never raise an interactive approval. So
   Hermes cannot be the enforcement point for "this send needs your OK."
3. **The MCP server process is shared across all sessions and receives no
   per-session identity** (no env, `clientInfo`, or `_meta` carries the session
   or job id). A `tools/call` cannot be attributed to a routine at the MCP
   boundary.

## Decision

### 1. Tokens live only in the Keychain; the agent can never read them

OAuth uses Google's native-app flow: PKCE (S256), a loopback redirect on an
ephemeral `127.0.0.1` port, and the real Google consent screen in the user's
default browser (never a webview). The refresh token is minted to the device
and stored via `keyring` v3 in a dedicated Keychain service
(`co.opensoftware.june.google`, `-dev` in debug), one item per account keyed by
email, holding a `Zeroize`/`ZeroizeOnDrop` token blob. This reuses the exact
plumbing proven by OS Accounts sign-in (`os_accounts.rs`).

Only a non-secret index (email, granted scopes, status) lives in the app DB, so
accounts can be enumerated without touching the Keychain. The Seatbelt profile
denies both Keychain database paths (`Library/Keychains`) and the `securityd`
Mach services used by Keychain APIs; the dev plaintext fallback file, when
enabled, is added to the sandbox deny-read set and the secret-filename denylist.

### 2. Connector API calls originate on-device and never transit June API

The MCP servers (`june_gmail*`, `june_gcal*`) are stdlib-only Python scripts
that hold **no** OAuth token. They call the app's existing on-device loopback
proxy (the "provider proxy" in `hermes_bridge.rs`) with a **dedicated connector
token**, scoped by route, mirroring the `june_recorder` token-isolation
precedent rather than reusing the general model token. The proxy's connector
routes resolve the real access token from the Keychain in Rust and call Google's
REST API **directly**. June API (the TEE backend) is not in the connector data
path. This is the concrete meaning of "OpenSoftware's servers hold no key to
your mail."

Model inference for a routine still follows the user's provider selection (June
API by default, or a local model). The "not in the data path" claim covers
token custody and provider calls, never inference; the copy says so.

### 3. Trust modes are enforced in the Rust proxy, not by prompting the model

Every connector-aware routine carries a trust mode: `read_only` -> `approval`
-> `autonomous`, tracked in an app-side `routine_trust` table (the source of
truth, not the Hermes job record). Plain/read-only routines start `read_only`;
routines that enable connector actions start in `approval`.

- **read_only**: the routine's `enabled_toolsets` include only the read servers
  (`june_gmail`, `june_gcal`). The mutating servers are simply absent, so the
  model cannot call them. Enforced by Hermes toolset resolution.
- **approval**: the routine also gets the action servers
  (`june_gmail_actions`, `june_gcal_actions`). Every mutating route in the proxy
  parks the call in an app-side pending-approval registry, emits a Tauri event,
  and blocks until the user approves or denies in June's own UI (batched;
  600 s timeout -> denied). This is where the enforcement lives, precisely
  because Hermes will not gate these calls itself.
- **autonomous**: unlocked only after the routine has run correctly under
  approval at least three times ("earned autonomy"). A grant mints a per-routine
  token bound to `(job_id, allowed_tools, account)`; the proxy executes those
  specific tools without parking, and parks everything else.

Trust modes are kept visually and structurally separate from the existing
Sandboxed/Unrestricted runtime mode: trust governs outward actions, the sandbox
governs local system access.

### 4. Event triggers via an app-side polling daemon

A Rust daemon polls Gmail `history.list` deltas and upcoming calendar events
while the Mac is awake (backing off when idle, pausing on low battery), and
fires subscribed routines through the existing bridge run-now action. Event
routines are created paused with a distant one-shot schedule; the daemon is what
actually triggers them, so no cron string encodes an event. Cursors persist per
account.

## Consequences

- **The headline privacy claim is enforceable and true in local mode.** A
  compromise of OpenSoftware infrastructure yields no token that can read mail;
  the tokens are on the device, and connector traffic never reaches the backend.
- **Autonomy grants do not leak into interactive chat.** The pinned runtime
  auto-includes globally enabled MCP servers by default, so June sets an
  explicit dashboard/TUI toolset pin. It includes the base connector servers
  (whose actions park for approval) and excludes every per-routine
  `june_*_auto_*` server. Cron still resolves those servers from each job's
  explicit `enabled_toolsets`.
- **Applying connector config requires a runtime restart.** `config.yaml` is
  only rendered on runtime start, so connect/disconnect/grant changes restart
  the mode-scoped Hermes runtime, exactly as the model switch and MCP admin
  changes already do. No hot reload.
- **Scopes are requested incrementally.** Read scopes first; `gmail.send` is
  requested only when a user enables an autonomous send routine. This protects
  consent conversion and eases Google's restricted-scope (CASA) review, which is
  the program's external critical path and independent of this ADR.
- **We deviate from the plan's "new crate" language.** `src-tauri` is a single
  crate, not a workspace; connectors are a module (`src-tauri/src/connectors/`),
  matching the house pattern. No behavior change; recorded here so the
  discrepancy with the plan doc is not mistaken for an omission.
