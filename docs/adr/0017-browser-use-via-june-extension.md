# Browser use runs in the user's own browser via a June extension

## Status

accepted - JUN-278. Supersedes the browsing-surface recommendation of the
JUN-229 scope proposal (PR #689, closed unmerged); that proposal's surface
inventory, consent-token pattern, and public-web policy carry forward into
this decision. (ADR 0016 is reserved by the private-connectors PR.)

## Context

June's agent web surface is read-only: `june_web` offers search and one-URL
fetch, nothing stateful. The Plugins epic (JUN-275) makes browser use and
computer use launch plugins (JUN-278). The JUN-229 scope work recommended a
June-managed ephemeral browser as the only v1 surface and made "never attach
to the user's normal profile" its core privacy boundary.

Product review overruled that boundary for attended use: the tasks users
actually want (act on my sites, on my behalf) require their signed-in
sessions, which an ephemeral profile cannot provide. Three attended
mechanisms were weighed: a June-managed pinned browser (no sign-in, heavy
packaging), attaching to the user's running browser over its debugging port
(relaunch flags, no pairing story), and a store-distributed extension
(store-enforced pairing to a native host, per-tab debugger control, visible
debugging banner).

The pinned upstream runtime was also evaluated. Its browser mode is
attach-only with no launch or policy layer, so it cannot carry June's policy.
Its computer-use toolset, in contrast, is production-shaped: background
control through cua-driver (events posted directly to the target process, no
cursor, focus, or Space theft), element-indexed captures, an
accessibility-only mode for text models, and approval hooks on every
mutating action. It lacks only packaging, consent, and TCC onboarding.

## Decision

Two tracks behind one app-owned `june_browser` MCP contract, gated by one
stored Browser access grant:

- **Attended sessions drive the user's own Chromium-family browser** through
  a June MV3 extension paired to a signed native-messaging shim inside the
  app, relaying to the Rust browser broker over an authenticated local
  socket. Actions run over per-tab debugger control in task-owned, visibly
  grouped tabs, plus tabs the user explicitly shares; pre-existing tabs are
  otherwise untouchable. Every consequential action parks in the broker for
  a chat approval card, with a per-task per-site allow; password, one-time
  code, and payment entry are never automated.
- **Unattended routines get a broker-launched managed browser**: a detected
  system Chromium-family binary run headless with a fresh ephemeral profile,
  public-web-only policy re-checked after redirects, consequential classes
  hard-blocked, per-routine opt-in.
- **Computer use (phase 2) productizes the pinned runtime's computer-use
  toolset**: a pinned, signed cua-driver bundled as an app resource (the
  upstream network installer never runs), TCC onboarding on the dictation
  helper pattern, runtime approvals surfaced as June approval cards, and a
  hard requirement for a vision-capable model.

Policy decisions are made in Rust at the broker choke point, never by
prompting the model (the connectors precedent).

## Consequences

- June's trust story changes: the agent can act inside the user's signed-in
  sessions. The compensating controls are structural, not prompt-level:
  task-tab isolation, the browser's own debugging banner as an indicator the
  model cannot suppress, and broker-parked approvals.
- Browser actions now gate coherently with connector mutations; without
  this, a signed-in browser would be an ungated bypass of the connectors'
  approval surface.
- The store listing, publisher account, and review latency join the release
  critical path, and the native-messaging protocol carries a version
  handshake because the store updates the extension independently of app
  releases.
- The routines track depends on an installed Chromium-family browser; no
  engine is bundled in v1.
- Private-system-interface risk in cua-driver is accepted for phase 2 behind
  a pinned driver version and a release self-test.

## Addendum, 2026-07-13: the grant is the only authorization gate, and where
## the sandbox does not help

Building the JUN-286 and JUN-287 skeletons surfaced two facts about this
trust boundary that the decision above assumed without stating. Both are
recorded here because the next slices build approval surfaces directly on
them, and a reader who assumes otherwise will place an enforcement point
where there is none.

**The loopback token is not a boundary against the agent.** Each internal MCP
server gets a distinct loopback token (provider, recorder, browser) so that
one MCP subprocess cannot call another's routes. That is real, and it is all
it is. The tokens are rendered in plaintext into the runtime's own
`config.yaml`, and the Seatbelt profile is a *write* jail: it denies reads
only for a short secret denylist, and the runtime's home is readable by
design because the runtime must read its own config. The agent can therefore
read any of its tokens and call the loopback proxy directly, bypassing the
runtime's toolset gating. Consequently **the Browser access grant, re-checked
in the Rust broker on every request, is the sole authorization gate for
`/v1/browser/*`.** Tool-layer gating in the runtime is ergonomics, not
enforcement. Every consequential-action approval must be enforced in the
broker (JUN-297), never at the runtime's tool-dispatch layer.

**The grant is read at request time, not cached at spawn.** The grant was
initially a value captured when a runtime spawned. That cannot hold: revoke
runs outside the lock that serializes spawns, so a spawn already in flight
would come up with browser access and survive the revoke, and a spawn
interleaving with the revoke could re-enable the broker from a flag file that
no longer exists. The broker now consults the persisted grant on every
browser request and fails closed. A `stat` per request is free relative to the
loopback round trip, and it makes revocation authoritative regardless of what
any runtime process believes.

**Known gap, deliberately not closed here.** The grant is a presence file in
app data, outside every sandbox write root, so a *jailed* runtime cannot
grant itself browser access. An Unrestricted-mode session runs with no
Seatbelt profile at all and could create that file, producing a persisted,
UI-visible grant the user never gave. This is consent integrity rather than
capability escalation (an Unrestricted agent already has a shell), and the
same shape exists in the shipped Agent CLI access grant, so the fix is a
shared one: bind the grant to a value the app can verify rather than trusting
file presence. Tracked separately; it is not closed by this ADR.

## Addendum, 2026-07-15: routine opt-in is bound by a per-job credential

The gateway marks cron execution only with the process-global value
`HERMES_CRON_SESSION=1`; it does not expose the active job id to MCP children,
and multiple jobs can run concurrently. That marker therefore cannot bind a
browser request to one routine, and a job id supplied in the request body
would be forgeable by the model.

Each opted-in routine instead receives a distinct June-authored MCP server and
random bearer credential. The routine's stored `enabled_toolsets` selects that
server. The provider proxy maps the credential to June-side routine state, and
the Rust browser broker re-checks that routine's opt-in on every request,
including requests made through an already-running managed session. Disabling
the opt-in retains the credential only for authentication and refusal, removes
the server from rendered configuration, and makes the broker return
`browser_routine_not_opted_in`. Attended credentials remain a separate class
and never consult routine opt-ins.

2026-07-27 addendum: ADR-0040 supersedes this ADR's `june_browser` MCP-server integration shape; the Browser use and Computer use product scope and broker policies remain binding.
