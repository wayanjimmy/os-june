# Audio pipeline — capture to note

How June records meeting audio, separates sources, detects conversation turns,
and transcribes into a note. It is **saved-audio-first**: the local WAV is the
source of truth, provider speed is secondary. See
[ADR-0005](adr/0005-source-separated-audio-capture.md) (one WAV per source),
[ADR-0004](adr/0004-out-of-process-system-audio-helper.md) (system-audio
helper), and [ADR-0002](adr/0002-live-transcript-preview-strategy.md) (live
preview).

## Data flow

1. **`start_recording`** → `capture::start_capture` opens `microphone.partial.wav`
   (a CPAL input stream) and, in meeting mode, starts the system-audio helper
   writing `system.partial.wav`.
2. Per input callback: convert samples to 16-bit PCM, update lock-free level
   atomics, and publish fixed-size blocks into a preallocated bounded audio
   ring. The callback allocates nothing, takes no locks, and performs no I/O.
   A dedicated non-real-time task drains the ring into the WAV writer and
   non-blockingly feeds the **live preview** sink; its worker transcribes ~8s
   chunks and emits ephemeral `live-transcript-event`s that are **never
   persisted**. The ring holds 30 seconds at the configured sample rate and
   channel count, with a memory cap for unusual high-channel devices. If disk
   writing ever falls more than that capacity behind, the oldest queued blocks
   are dropped, exact dropped-sample counts appear in recording status, and
   recovery/finalization checkpoints persist the count. Writer progress is
   tracked separately from callback production: `bytesWritten` advances only
   after successful WAV writes. The first writer I/O error, panic, unexpected
   exit, or sustained stall stops the drain and immediately enters the existing
   microphone warning path; recovery checkpoints persist its diagnostic code.
   Each queued block also carries its callback generation, so overflow cannot
   merge surviving live-preview audio across a dropped callback boundary.
3. **`finish_recording`** stops the input stream, drains and finalizes the
   writer task, then atomically renames
   `*.partial.wav` → `*.wav` (the durability commit), stops the helper, cancels
   preview. Completed microphone byte metadata is replaced from the writer
   watermark returned after that final drain.
4. **`process_saved_source_audio`** (`src-tauri/src/domain/processing.rs`) runs
   the batch pipeline for microphone-only and dual-Source recordings:
   `drop_silent_system_sources` → dual-Source `turns::detect_turns` (or one
   authoritative full-Source microphone job) → reconcile durable fingerprinted
   note-transcription jobs → bounded Turn preparation → one
   in-flight provider request per Source → atomically persist each successful
   job and transcript row → **note generation**. Full-Source fallbacks are
   prepared lazily when a Source is materially incomplete and atomically
   replace that Source's partial rows only after the replacement succeeds.

While capture is active, the native meeting-HUD supervisor samples capture at
20 Hz and emits the additive `recording-telemetry` Tauri event. Its narrow
payload carries the recording session id, state, elapsed time, audio levels,
and live warnings; both the main renderer and meeting HUD subscribe to that
single stream. In the main renderer, the latest sample stays in a narrow
external store: waveform subscribers receive level samples at 20 Hz, elapsed
time subscribers publish only on whole-second boundaries, and the root App
reducer receives only lifecycle, Source-health, and actionable-warning changes.
Stable metadata still comes from the recording commands, and
`get_recording_status` remains available as a read-only compatibility command.
Recovery durability is independent of telemetry: a recording-scoped worker
requests a ring watermark flush and checkpoints elapsed time every 500 ms after
the recording rows are created. The WAV task drains through that watermark and
flushes the WAV before the recovery row advances. A dead writer releases the
flush wait so recovery state and diagnostics continue advancing instead of
waiting for the full timeout.

## Automatic meeting completion

Only a recording started from the native meeting prompt is eligible for
automatic completion. At start, June snapshots the allowlisted external app
families that own the microphone and persists the recording origin, app-family
set, and eligibility on `recording_sessions`. Manual, agent-started, and
recovered recordings remain ineligible.

The CoreAudio meeting detector keeps polling during capture. Meeting completion
does not inspect audio levels or speech activity: silence during a meeting is
not end evidence. Instead, every originating app family must be absent from 15
consecutive successful one-second microphone-ownership probes. That transition
opens a visible 15-second countdown in both the recording HUD and the main
recording surface. Microphone ownership returning cancels the countdown; Keep
recording suppresses it for the rest of that recording; Stop now skips the
remaining grace period. Probe failures, unknown external microphone processes,
sign-out, and polling gaps such as sleep reset the absence evidence and fail
open.

When the countdown expires, native code retains one idempotent finish request
until the main renderer receives and acknowledges it. The renderer uses the
ordinary `finish_recording` command, so writer drain, atomic WAV finalization,
validation, processing, and saved-audio recovery remain the same as a manual
stop.

After finalization, `process_saved_source_audio` emits additive
`note-processing-progress` events when a Note enters `transcribing` and
`generating`, then emits `done` with the terminal status and the Note row's
`updated_at` revision. The renderer updates stage-only state from intermediate
events and hydrates the full Note once on `done`; it drains any debounced
editor save for that Note before the hydration. `get_note` remains available
for navigation and compatibility, but is no longer polled during processing.

## System-audio helper IPC contract

The helper is controlled and observed out-of-process (see ADR-0004):

- **Control:** Unix signals — `SIGUSR1` / `SIGUSR2` = pause / resume,
  `SIGTERM` / `SIGKILL` = stop. Launched via `/usr/bin/open -n`.
- **Observation:** a `status.json` file with events `ready` / `level` / `error`
  / `stopped` (fields include `level` / `maxLevel` / `message`).
- **Routing:** a private stereo process tap is bound to the current default
  system output device, so it records the same device stream the user hears.
  The private aggregate contains the tap only; adding a physical output
  subdevice can create an output-only IO cycle with no tap callbacks. The helper
  performs at most one full-graph rebuild for missing callbacks or zero-filled
  buffers. If callbacks still stall or remain zero-filled after that rebuild,
  the helper reports the system source unavailable instead of silently writing
  a meeting-length silent WAV or entering a restart loop. Ordinary sustained
  silence remains subject to the saved-audio speech gate below.
- **CLI:** `--output` / `--status` / `--pid` / `--log`.
- **Timeouts:** ~30s readiness, ~75s probe. **macOS 14.2+** required for
  CoreAudio process taps; older systems get microphone-only.

## Turn detection

Energy-based, per-source, **no diarization**:

- 30 ms RMS windows; the activity threshold is the ~20th-percentile window
  energy times a per-source `noise_multiplier` (separates speech from
  background).
- Hysteresis: `start_active_ms` / `end_silence_ms` / `min_turn_ms` /
  `merge_gap_ms`, with separate microphone vs system config tables
  (`config_for_source`).
- Pre-provider silence checks require at least 180 ms of consecutive activity;
  one loud device-start window cannot certify an otherwise silent Source.
- Turns are ordered purely by `start_ms` / `turn_index`.
- **Speaker-echo trimming:** because the two sources are not captured through a
  single mixer, a remote participant's voice bleeding from the speakers into the
  mic can raise a false microphone turn. The detector trims the system-dominated
  spans out of a mic turn (keeping the genuine remainder) rather than dropping
  the whole turn, so a user's reply that merged with an echo survives.

## Normalization and chunking

Before transcription each turn WAV is downmixed to **mono**, resampled to
**16 kHz**, and gain-adjusted toward a target peak (bounded, with a
reuse-original shortcut when already loud enough). Normalization uses two
streaming passes over bounded raw-sample chunks: the first computes the
downmixed peak and sample count, and the second carries one global linear
resampler position across chunks while applying gain and writing incrementally.
Its working memory is fixed regardless of recording duration, and its global
resampler position preserves the historical whole-buffer output byte for byte.
The normalized WAV is then split into **≤30-second** chunks with rolling
context.

## Recovery

`scan_recoverable_recordings` reads `recording_sessions` + `audio_artifacts`.
The governing rule: **bytes on disk win over DB status** — the mic WAV is
flushed periodically and the finalized filename only appears after a clean
finalize, so a crash leaves replayable audio that recovery can finish
processing. Durable note-transcription jobs record exact Source spans and
attempt state; interrupted `running` jobs return to `pending`, and explicit
Retry resumes only jobs whose fingerprint has not already succeeded.
