# June Companion local development

## Prerequisites

Use Rust with `aarch64-apple-ios-sim`, Xcode 26, and XcodeGen 2.45.4 or newer.
The native app has no Node, Metro, React Native, or CocoaPods dependency.
Local June API permits the in-memory relay; restart loses links.

June Companion does not need an OS Accounts OAuth registration. Pairing is
created by a signed-in June Desktop and authorizes the phone with a revocable
device credential after explicit Desktop approval. The Desktop token is never
copied.

## Run

```sh
cd ../june-companion-app/native-ios  # the mobile app lives in the june-companion-app repo
xcodegen generate
open JuneCompanion.xcodeproj
```

Run June API and a signed-in June Desktop with the relay URL. Open Desktop
Settings > Linked devices and show a pairing code. Scan it from the companion,
or expand Enter a code instead on Desktop and choose Enter pairing code on the
phone. Review the device name and capabilities on Desktop, then approve.
The phone shows Cancel pairing while it waits, and cancellation revokes or
records cleanup for any proposal already sent to the relay.

The manual code is a URL-safe encoding of the exact short-lived QR bootstrap
payload. It contains the same pairing secret, expires after five minutes, and
still requires explicit Desktop approval. Treat it like the QR: do not log it,
store it, or include it in screenshots. Copying is explicit. Desktop does not
read or automatically clear the clipboard because a read-then-clear sequence
could erase newer content copied by another application. The five-minute
expiry and explicit Desktop approval are the authorization backstops.

## Verify

```sh
cd ../june-companion-app/native-ios  # the mobile app lives in the june-companion-app repo
xcodegen generate
xcodebuild -project JuneCompanion.xcodeproj -scheme JuneCompanion \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17 Pro,OS=26.5' test
xcodebuild -project JuneCompanion.xcodeproj -scheme JuneCompanion \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPad Pro 13-inch (M5),OS=26.5' build
cargo test --manifest-path crates/june-companion-protocol/Cargo.toml
cargo test --manifest-path crates/june-companion-crypto/Cargo.toml
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test:rust
pnpm test:june-api
```

Build both an iPhone and iPad simulator destination with `xcodebuild` and take
screenshots. Simulator cannot prove Face ID/passcode policy, camera scanning,
APNs delivery, or distribution signing. Test those on a signed physical device.
