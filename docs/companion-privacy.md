# June Companion privacy and metadata

End-to-end encrypted content includes note titles/bodies, prompts, agent
messages/deltas/status payloads, safe settings, recording controls, focus
targets, operation results, and protocol errors. Device private/session keys
and device credentials never enter the SwiftUI application model. Pairing
secrets are held only as transient QR or manual-code input during bootstrap and
are never published in a snapshot or persisted by the application model. The
explicit copy action places the short-lived bootstrap capability on the system
clipboard, where it may remain in clipboard history after it expires. Desktop
does not read the clipboard or risk erasing newer content. The relay receives a
device credential only for verification and persists only the SHA-256 hash of
its encoded authorization value; it never receives the Noise pairing secret.

June API necessarily observes the desktop's OS Accounts user id, linked device ids and
public keys, device display names, link/revocation timestamps, APNs device
token, source IP, connection times, frame timing, routing pairs, and ciphertext
sizes. It stores trust metadata, device credential hashes, and APNs tokens, but
never stores relay frames
or undelivered ciphertext. Logs contain route/error classes and aggregate
counts, never payload bytes, token values, keys, device tokens, note text, or
prompt text.

APNs receives only a content-available background payload. It contains no
visible body, title, note id, prompt, response, operation id, or account data.
Push hints are correctness-independent and rate-limited per offline device.

The iOS privacy manifest declares the generated device identifier, linked user
identifier, connection/route usage metadata, and device trust metadata used for
app functionality. It also declares the system/light/dark preference stored in
UserDefaults under required-reason category CA92.1. The companion does not use
those values for tracking and declares no tracking domains.

The phone's recent snapshot cache is AES-GCM encrypted with a random Keychain
key. Both the key and cache file use after-first-unlock device-only protection
so a content-free background push can refresh the cache while the screen is
locked. June still requires device-owner authentication before rendering it.
The cache supports rendering only and is not offline synchronization.
