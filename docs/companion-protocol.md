# June Companion protocol

The shared crate is `crates/june-companion-protocol`; desktop and iOS crypto
use `crates/june-companion-crypto`.

## Envelope and bounds

Protocol version 1 frames carry an operation id, monotonic per-session
sequence, issue and expiry times, required capability, and one typed body.
Control TTL is 30 seconds. Encoded plaintext is capped at 44 KiB, ciphertext
at 45 KiB, relay JSON at 64 KiB, text at 32 KiB, and pages at 100 items.
Unknown versions fail closed. Additive optional fields or new variants require
a version-aware compatibility test before shipping.

The relay envelope contains only routing metadata and base64 ciphertext. It
cannot express a desktop command or application payload.

## Crypto sessions

Pairing uses `Noise_XXpsk3_25519_ChaChaPoly_BLAKE2s`; the scanned or manually
entered pairing code contributes a 32-byte single-use PSK and the transcript
authenticates both static identities. Linked reconnects use
`Noise_KK_25519_ChaChaPoly_BLAKE2s` with the approved static keys. Noise nonces
reject replay and reordering/tampering. A fresh handshake is required after
2^20 messages or 24 hours.

The relay pairing API receives only SHA-256 of the pairing secret as a
five-minute proof. The phone generates an opaque device credential and submits only its
encoded UTF-8 value's hash during pairing. Desktop approval activates that
hash. The phone later presents the same encoded value with the `Device` scheme;
the relay hashes that representation and compares it without retaining the
plaintext. Noise separately authenticates the device's private key and protects
all content.

The signed-in Desktop creates the pending pairing under its OS Accounts user.
The matching pairing proof authorizes one phone proposal to that exact pairing,
so the phone neither supplies an account id nor carries an account bearer. The
relay binds the proposed device to the user already fixed by Desktop creation,
and explicit Desktop approval remains required before the device credential or
link becomes active.

During an explicit pairing, the authenticated desktop may establish its relay
socket while the pairing is still pending, but pending phones remain unable to
connect or route frames. Before the relay exposes approval to the phone, the
desktop validates and stores the proposed device identity, marks the Noise
pairing secret ready locally, and confirms that relay socket is connected. A
confirmed remote approval failure rolls back that local readiness; an unknown
network outcome preserves it so an approved phone is never stranded between
the two boundaries. The relay also refuses to start its bounded persistence
step in the final 16 seconds of the pairing window. Postgres checks the pairing
expiry in the same transaction that activates the durable device link. Only a
durably activated link may finish in memory after the wall-clock expiry passes;
an expired transaction rolls back the device and link writes together. An
approval retry recognizes an already committed matching link and reconciles the
in-memory pairing instead of treating a lost commit response as an identity
conflict.

## Capabilities

The only grants are notes read/edit, agent read/chat/cancel, safe settings
read/edit, existing-recording state/pause/resume/stop, app focus, and
self-device read/revoke. Body-to-capability equality is validated before
dispatch.

Agent session and message reads go through typed frontend intents backed by
the current Hermes session APIs. The companion receives the same sanitized
display text as June Desktop: machine context, provider routing details,
reasoning, tool calls/results, approvals, secrets, and media internals stay on
the Mac. The always-mounted app shell serves reads even when the Agent screen
is closed. Send and cancel intents wake the existing Agent workspace.
Wire session identifiers are qualified explicitly: agent data uses
`storedSessionId`, while active-recording snapshots and controls use
`recordingSessionId`. The companion protocol does not expose a Hermes runtime
session id.

Agent transcript pagination starts with the newest page and walks backward;
items within each page remain chronological so the mobile client can prepend
older pages without reordering a conversation. Pages keep encoded results
below the frame budget. An individual oversized display message is clearly
marked as truncated. Notes
whose editable title or content cannot fit safely in one frame are rejected
with an instruction to open them on the Mac; the companion never loads a
truncated note into its editor, which prevents an edit from overwriting unseen
content.

There is no variant for arbitrary Tauri/Hermes calls, recording start, note
delete, approvals, unrestricted mode, filesystem, shell, credentials,
connectors, updates, account deletion, or adding a device.

## Idempotency and reconnect

Mutations carry stable client operation ids. The native client keeps an
unresolved id in Keychain for seven days and reuses it after an ambiguous
disconnect or relaunch, and it does not dispatch until that id is durably
stored. The desktop writes an outcome-unknown reservation before every mutation
crosses a side-effect boundary. A final response replaces the reservation and
is returned on retry. If Desktop crashes in between, the reservation is
returned as a distinct outcome-unknown error instead of dispatching the
mutation again; the user checks June on the Mac before explicitly choosing the
action again. Results and reservations expire after seven days. Completed
responses are capped at 1,024 per device; up to 128 unresolved reservations are
retained separately, and reaching that bound refuses new mutations instead of
evicting a reservation. Revocation removes both. Sequence state resets only
after a fresh authenticated Noise session. The client reuses
a healthy transport, retires stale Noise keys when a fresh authenticated
handshake arrives, and refreshes cursor-based lists after foreground/reconnect.
No offline control request is replayed.

Desktop upgrades rewrite the earlier retryable-busy reservation payload to the
pending, non-retryable outcome-unknown form before normal pruning runs. Existing
ambiguity guards therefore keep their at-most-once meaning across the schema
upgrade.

Note edits carry `expectedRevision`; SQLite updates atomically only at that
revision. A mismatch returns a typed conflict with the current note.
