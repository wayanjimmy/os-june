# Hermes agent runtime — architecture

How June embeds and drives the Hermes agent runtime as its chat/agent brain.
For *why* it is embedded and sandboxed, see
[ADR-0006](adr/0006-embed-hermes-sandboxed-runtime.md). For the code-level
contract of the typed event seam, `src/lib/hermes-control-plane/README.md` is
the best entry point. For bumping the pinned runtime, see
[hermes-upgrade-checklist.md](hermes-upgrade-checklist.md). For the sharp
edges of the integration (restart discipline, the config.yaml contract, MCP
OAuth, event types), see
[hermes-gateway-gotchas.md](hermes-gateway-gotchas.md).

## Layers

June wraps Hermes in four layers, cleanly separated:

- **Bridge** (`src-tauri/src/hermes_bridge.rs`, Rust) — spawns Hermes child
  processes under a macOS Seatbelt sandbox, injects the `SOUL.md` identity, runs
  a shared on-device provider proxy (identity stripping / retention enforcement
  before any inference leaves the device), bundles two Python MCP servers
  (`june_context` = search the user's notes/dictation, `june_web` = web via a
  token-gated loopback proxy), and exposes ~50 Tauri commands.
- **Gateway** (`src/lib/hermes-gateway.ts`) — `HermesGatewayClient`: pure
  JSON-RPC-over-WebSocket transport (connect coalescing, request/response
  correlation, timeouts, `4009` "session busy").
- **Control plane** (`src/lib/hermes-control-plane/`) — the typed seam.
  `classifyHermesEvent` is a **total** function: every raw frame maps to exactly
  one `JuneHermesEvent`, and unknown frames become a visible `unsupported` event
  rather than vanishing. `methods.ts` builds typed outbound RPC; `compatibility/
  matrix.ts` pins `PINNED_HERMES_VERSION` and gates features.
- **Adapter** (`src/lib/hermes-adapter.ts`) — session-list normalization (titles,
  scheduled-run detection, subagent filtering), distinct from the live-event
  control plane.

`src/components/agent/AgentWorkspace.tsx` is the React surface that wires these
together (composer, transcript, session list, model switching, attachments,
approval/clarify/sudo/secret UIs). `src/lib/agent-chat-runtime.ts` turns
classified events into `AgentChatTurn` / `AgentChatPart[]` for rendering.

## Submit flow

1. Composer text → `AgentWorkspace.submit`.
2. `ensureHermesGateway(unrestricted?)` picks/creates a `HermesGatewayClient`
   from `gatewaysRef` — **one gateway per write-mode**.
3. `gateway.request("session.create")` returns **both** a `stored_session_id`
   (June's persistent id) and a `session_id` (the live runtime id);
   `ensureHermesBridgeSession` persists the mapping.
4. Images are attached via `image.attach_bytes` (bytes read at attach time,
   never stored on state/trace/artifacts).
5. `gateway.request("prompt.submit")` (ack-style) → live `event` frames →
   `classifyHermesEvent` → `agent-chat-runtime` builds turns → React renders.

## Key concepts

- **Two runtimes keyed by write-mode.** `gatewaysRef: Map<boolean, client>`;
  `sandboxed` (default) vs `unrestricted` (per-session opt-in). Follow-ups route
  to the runtime matching the session's original mode, so one unrestricted
  session cannot un-sandbox others.
- **Stored vs runtime session id.** The UI keys everything on the persistent
  **stored** id; RPCs target the live **runtime** id. Sessions render
  optimistically before the first message persists, with rollback/migrate paths.
  Conflating the two attaches traces/artifacts to the wrong session — always say
  which id you mean (see CONTEXT.md).
- **Admin traffic goes server-side.** All admin/dashboard calls (skills, MCP,
  toolsets, env, cron) route through the Rust `hermes_admin_request` proxy — the
  webview is cross-origin to the Hermes dashboard and must never hold its token.
- **Model switching is a `/model` dispatch trusting only the gateway ack.**
  `hermes-model-switch.ts` encodes exactly three honest outcomes
  (`active-session-switched` / `default-changed` / `switch-failed`); it never
  claims a running session moved unless the dispatch acked.
- **Model capabilities come from the live Venice catalog, never traits** — see
  [ADR-0007](adr/0007-model-capability-source-of-truth.md). The model catalog is
  Rust-side (`src-tauri/src/providers/mod.rs`, backed by June API's Venice
  catalog).
- **The control plane is the sole reader of raw Hermes frames.** Every
  consumer (`agent-chat-runtime`, `hermes-trace-buffer`, `hermes-session-steer`)
  works from classified `JuneHermesEvent`s, never from raw frames. Every
  normalized event carries `receivedAt`; first-party local kinds (`steering`)
  are minted by June and never come out of `classifyHermesEvent`.
- **Identity override.** June rewrites the runtime's persona at prompt-build time
  via an injected `SOUL.md`; June presents as June, never as Hermes.

## Slash commands

Builtin composer slash commands are **`/model`**, **`/file`**, and
**`/image`** — the last gated off behind `IMAGE_GENERATION_ENABLED`
(`src/lib/agent-composer-slash-commands.ts`) — plus **skill** slash commands
(`skill-slash-commands.ts`).

## Key Tauri commands

`start/stop_hermes_bridge`, `ensure_hermes_bridge_gateway`,
`hermes_bridge_status`, `hermes_bridge_sessions` / `_session_messages` /
`ensure_hermes_bridge_session`, `hermes_admin_request`, `hermes_bridge_skills` /
`toolsets` / `messaging_platforms`, `hermes_bridge_cron_jobs` (+CRUD),
`import_hermes_bridge_file(_bytes)`, `hermes_bridge_file_preview` / `_text`,
`hermes_mcp_oauth_login`, `list_venice_models` / `set_venice_model`,
`open_hermes_tui_debug`.
