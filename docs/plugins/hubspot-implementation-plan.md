# Implementation plan: HubSpot plugin

- **Mode:** CTO
- **Date:** 2026-07-14
- **Status:** Proposed; auth and permission spike required
- **PRD:** [hubspot-prd.md](hubspot-prd.md)

## Technical objective

Add pipeline-bounded HubSpot reads and approved CRM actions through the
provider-neutral connector kit. Keep record selection, property allowlists,
stale-state checks, and approval enforcement in Rust.

## Phase 0: auth and access matrix

Before implementation:

1. Verify public app OAuth, refresh, revoke, app review, and scope-change flows.
2. Confirm that HubSpot still requires a client secret for authorization and
   refresh exchanges, and test whether it offers a supported public-client
   alternative.
3. Measure each proposed scope against Free, Starter, Professional, and
   Enterprise accounts and user permission variants.
4. Demonstrate the documented gap between CRM scope access and owned-record UI
   permissions with test users.
5. Reject an embedded secret. If a TEE exchange or user-created app is chosen,
   record the credential boundary in an ADR and user copy.

Exit with an approved token path, scope-to-tool table, supported account matrix,
and server-side revoke behavior.

## Proposed servers

| Server | Tools |
| --- | --- |
| `june_hubspot` | `search_crm`, `get_contact`, `get_company`, `get_deal`, `list_engagements`, `get_pipeline` |
| `june_hubspot_actions` | `create_note`, `create_task`, `update_deal_properties` |

Search returns compact ids, labels, associations, modified time, pipeline and
stage, owner, canonical URL, and an explicit list of omitted fields. Results
for contacts, companies, and engagements are filtered through a live
association to at least one deal currently in an allowed pipeline. Full record
reads accept bounded property lists from a reviewed registry.

## Authorization and state

- Keychain token material if Phase 0 preserves device custody.
- Portal id, user id, granted scopes, selected pipeline ids, property registry,
  capabilities, and health in SQLite.
- No CRM record bodies or engagement corpus at rest.
- Rust checks a resolved deal's current pipeline before returning content or
  accepting a mutation. For contacts, companies, and engagements, Rust follows
  current provider associations and requires at least one associated deal whose
  current pipeline is allowed. Search applies the same test before returning
  even compact metadata. Cached associations are never authorization evidence.

## Write model

- Notes and tasks require an explicit allowed deal plus any contacts or
  companies proven through its current associations.
- Deal updates are limited to a reviewed property allowlist. Stage changes are
  separately labeled in approval and excluded from batch approval.
- Preflight re-reads object modification time and current property values.
- Approval shows before/after fields, associations, destination links, and the
  June note excerpt leaving the device.
- Creation retries use a provider-supported idempotency mechanism if available.
  Otherwise June reconciles recent engagements by a stable local fingerprint
  and blocks replay when the outcome is ambiguous.

## Events and rate limits

V1 uses bounded polling of linked records and recent updates while June is
awake. The provider's webhook API is app-level and requires a public HTTPS
endpoint, so it is reserved for an accepted away-mode relay. Handle `429` and
provider retry guidance with account-scoped backoff and a request budget.

## Delivery slices after Phase 0

1. Connection, portal state, pipeline picker, revoke, and health.
2. Search and bounded reads with scope and permission fixtures.
3. Approved engagement note and follow-up task creation.
4. Approved deal-property updates with preflight conflicts.
5. Meeting-to-CRM skills, rc dogfood, metrics, and kill switch.

## Verification

- OAuth connect, refresh, denied scope, portal removal, provider revoke, and
  June disconnect.
- Cross-pipeline forged-id and broad-scope regression tests.
- Default and custom schema fixtures, archived stages, duplicate contacts,
  merged records, paging, partial responses, and rate limits.
- Action-journal tests for stale state, timeout, duplicate acknowledgement,
  ambiguous create, and restart.
- Prompt-injection corpus in names, notes, properties, associations, and URLs.
- Live portal walkthrough with restricted and administrator users.

## Rollout and decision gate

Use an internal test portal, a small founder-led sales pilot, then rc. No
backend credential exchange, webhook intake, or provider content relay ships
without an ADR because each changes the local-mode trust boundary.
