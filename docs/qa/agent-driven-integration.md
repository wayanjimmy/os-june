# Agent-driven integration QA

## Recommendation

Use a project skill as the first-class interface for full integration QA where
an agent opens June, clicks through the changed flow, inspects visible state,
and reports evidence. Keep deterministic test suites in CI, and promote only
stable, repeatable live checks into Playwright or Tauri WebDriver after they
have proven useful in repeated agent runs.

This gives June three QA layers:

1. Deterministic CI for contracts and logic: `pnpm test`, `pnpm test:rust`,
   `pnpm test:scribe-api`, and targeted Rust or Vitest suites.
2. Agent-driven live QA for product workflows: `$agent-e2e-qa` starts the app,
   chooses Browser, Chrome, or Computer Use, records and compresses the
   walkthrough as video when possible, then reports pass/fail evidence.
   Background browser recording is preferred for web-reachable flows when the
   user is actively using their desktop.
3. Promoted browser or native automation for stable walkthroughs that do not
   depend on secrets, production accounts, hardware, subjective layout review,
   or macOS permission prompts.

## Why a skill first

A single script is too narrow for the cases this repo needs to prove. June has
React views, Tauri commands, WKWebView behavior, native windows, tray and menu
behavior, global hotkeys, audio devices, OS permissions, OS Accounts handoffs,
and Stripe-adjacent flows. Those surfaces need different tools and different
levels of confirmation before side effects.

A skill can make the routing decision at runtime:

- Browser for web preview, DOM assertions, console errors, and screenshots.
- Background Playwright for web-reachable agent flows that should record video
  without bringing June or Chrome to the foreground. The bundled helper can
  shim the Tauri shell while routing prompts through a real isolated Hermes
  dashboard.
- Chrome for flows that intentionally hand off to the user's browser session.
- Computer Use for native Tauri windows, overlays, hotkeys, menu bar, tray,
  file pickers, permission panes, and audio UI.
- Terminal commands for starting local services, reading logs, and running
  targeted tests that support the live finding.

The skill also forces an evidence contract, which matters more than just
"clicked around" completion. A useful live QA result needs the command used, the
surface tested, the data mode, pass/fail checks, a video recording when
available, a compressed MP4 path or os-platform URL when sharing is requested,
screenshots or logs, and clear gaps for anything that was blocked.

## Repo-specific runbook

Default local data mode should avoid live OS Accounts unless the flow under test
is specifically account or billing QA. `.env.example` and `scribe-api/.env.example`
support local development with `OS_SCRIBE_LOCAL_DEV=1` and `local-dev-token`.

Use these entry points:

- Web preview: `pnpm dev`
- Native Tauri: `pnpm tauri:dev`
- First-run onboarding replay: `pnpm tauri:dev --replay-onboarding`

`pnpm tauri:dev` starts or reuses Vite at `127.0.0.1:1421` and the local Scribe
API at `127.0.0.1:8080`. Before reusing an occupied port, verify that the
process belongs to this repo.

Use `docs/qa/feature-user-stories.tsv` as the story inventory when a live run
maps to an existing user flow. Only update that tracker when the run actually
proved the row. Keep hardware, real account, and native overlay gaps explicit
when those surfaces were not covered.

Video artifacts should be prepared through the skill helper at
`.agents/skills/agent-e2e-qa/scripts/prepare_qa_video.py`. It transcodes raw
macOS screen recordings or Playwright `.webm` captures to no-audio H.264 MP4,
targets the os-platform file cap, uploads with `is_public=true` and
`purpose=attachment` only when PR sharing was requested, and can comment the
resulting URL on a GitHub PR. Public os-platform video links are visible to
anyone with the URL.

For the background agent prompt path, use:

```bash
.agents/skills/agent-e2e-qa/scripts/run_background_agent_prompt.mjs --prompt "hi"
python3 .agents/skills/agent-e2e-qa/scripts/prepare_qa_video.py \
  .tmp/qa-recordings/<timestamp>-background-agent-hi.webm \
  --upload --confirm-public --comment-pr <pr-number>
```

## Promotion criteria

Good candidates for deterministic promotion:

- Onboarding preview smoke checks.
- Settings navigation and saved preferences.
- Empty-state and dialog layering checks.
- Stable agent composer flows with mocked backend events.

Poor candidates for deterministic promotion:

- Microphone, system audio, accessibility, and global hotkey proof.
- OS Accounts, checkout, and portal flows.
- Update installation and relaunch.
- Menu bar, tray, HUD, or permission prompt placement on macOS.

When a flow is promoted, Browser-backed Playwright should be the first choice
for web-only behavior. Tauri WebDriver can be considered for stable native
flows, but it should not replace Computer Use for visual or OS-level proof.

## Current implementation

The project skill lives at `.agents/skills/agent-e2e-qa/SKILL.md`. It defines
the decision tree, tool routing, walkthrough loop, and evidence format for live
integration QA. Its bundled `scripts/run_background_agent_prompt.mjs` helper
records headless browser agent runs, and `scripts/prepare_qa_video.py` handles
video compression, os-platform upload, and optional PR comments.

## Example run

A first real run is checked in at
`docs/qa/agent-e2e-qa-runs/2026-06-26-onboarding-preview.md`. It used the new
skill contract to start a PR-branch web preview, drive the onboarding
permissions and trial flow with Chrome plus Computer Use, and record pass/fail
evidence plus gaps. The run intentionally stayed in local stubbed data mode:
no live account, checkout, native app, audio hardware, or macOS permission
prompt was exercised.
