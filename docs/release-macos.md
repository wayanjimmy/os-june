# Releasing June for macOS

June ships signed, notarized macOS builds with in-app auto-updates through
`tauri-plugin-updater`. The source repo stays private; update artifacts,
signatures, the DMG, and `latest.json` are published to the public
`open-software-network/os-june-releases` repo.

## macOS support

June supports macOS 14.0 and later on Apple Silicon and Intel Macs, including
macOS 15. Production and staging builds ship as universal macOS apps. System
audio capture uses Core Audio process taps and is available only on macOS 14.2
and later. On macOS 14.0 or 14.1, recording falls back to microphone-only mode.
The embedded Hermes resource carries separate complete `arm64` and `x86_64`
Python and site-packages trees behind one relocatable launcher. Release builds
execute both trees before the universal app is assembled.

The first updater-capable build must be installed manually once — earlier builds
ship without the updater, so they can't pull it in — and every release after that
updates in place. Choose the release version per semver when you run the release
workflow; don't hard-code a specific number in this runbook.

## One-time prerequisites

Create or confirm these before cutting the first updater release:

- Public GitHub repo: `open-software-network/os-june-releases`.
- Release GitHub App (org-owned) installed on the public releases repo with
  `contents:write`, exposed as `RELEASE_APP_ID` and `RELEASE_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`.
  The workflow mints a short-lived, repo-scoped token from it at run time
  (replaces the old `RELEASES_REPO_TOKEN` PAT). The same App can later be added
  as a ruleset bypass actor when `main` is protected.
- Apple signing secrets: `APPLE_CERTIFICATE`, `APPLE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`,
  `APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY`.
- Apple notarization API secrets: `APPLE_API_ISSUER`, `APPLE_API_KEY`,
  `APPLE_API_KEY_P8`.
- Updater signing secrets: `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY` and, when the key is
  password-protected, `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD`.
- Production runtime secrets: `PRODUCTION_OS_ACCOUNTS_URL`,
  `PRODUCTION_OS_ACCOUNTS_API_URL`, `PRODUCTION_OS_ACCOUNTS_CLIENT_ID`, and
  `PRODUCTION_JUNE_API_URL`.
- Slack incoming-webhook secret: `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`, configured for the release
  announcements channel. An absent or failing webhook warns but does not fail an
  otherwise successful RC build.
- Optional fast release runner: a dedicated self-hosted Mac Studio runner with
  the `desktop-release` label. See
  [desktop-release-runner.md](desktop-release-runner.md).

The updater keypair is separate from the Apple Developer ID certificate. The
public key is embedded in `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`; the private key must live
only in CI secrets and the team password manager. Losing the private key
permanently breaks auto-update for all builds signed with its public key.

Generate a keypair with:

```sh
pnpm tauri signer generate --write-keys keys/os-june-updater.key
```

Do not commit `keys/`. Copy the private key contents into
`TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY`, copy the password into
`TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD` if one was used, back both up, and embed
the `.pub` contents as the updater `pubkey`.

## Cutting a production release

Releases go through the release-candidate channel: build an RC, test it via the
in-app updater, then promote it to stable. There is no direct stable-build path.

### 1. Build a release candidate

```text
GitHub Actions -> rc-desktop-release -> Run workflow
  base-version = X.Y.Z   (the version you are heading toward)
  rc-number    = 1        (2, 3, ... for later candidates)
  macos-runner = mac-studio
```

`rc-desktop-release` builds a signed + notarized `universal-apple-darwin` app at
version `X.Y.Z-rc.N` (bundling both Hermes runtime architectures), and publishes it to a fixed
`rc` prerelease in `open-software-network/os-june-releases` with `latest-rc.json`.
The fixed `June_universal.dmg` asset follows the current RC for the updater, while
an immutable versioned DMG remains available for each Slack announcement. The
versioned asset is uploaded without replacement before the fixed RC release
channel aliases; reuse a higher RC number if that append-only upload already
exists. The workflow records the source commit in `rc-build.json` (so promote can
rebuild the same tree) and does NOT touch `main`. It also fails closed if it
cannot read the current RC metadata, preserving the RC release channel's
forward-only ordering.
After the desktop asset publishes, the extension release job compares its build
inputs with the latest stable extension. Changed inputs are packaged, attached
to the same fixed `rc` release, and submitted to Chrome for deferred publication;
unchanged inputs make no store write. See
[release-extension.md](release-extension.md).

### 2. Test the candidate

In the app: Settings -> About -> Release channel -> Release candidate, then check
for updates. The app follows `latest-rc.json` and installs the RC. Iterate with a
higher `rc-number` until it is good.

### 3. Promote to stable

```text
GitHub Actions -> promote-desktop-release -> Run workflow
  rc-version = X.Y.Z-rc.N   (required; must match the current rc release exactly)
  macos-runner = mac-studio
```

`rc-version` is required and must equal the version the `rc` release currently
holds; a mismatch (or a blank field) fails the run, so you can never promote a
different candidate than you intend.

Before the macOS stable build starts, promotion also freezes and verifies the RC
extension metadata. If the extension changed, Chrome must have approved that
exact package into `STAGED`; pending review or any version/hash mismatch blocks
the whole stable release. After the desktop release succeeds, the same reviewed
extension package is published to stable. Allow for Chrome review time when
planning a release.

`promote-desktop-release` checks out the exact commit the RC was built from,
stamps the clean `X.Y.Z`, and reruns the full sign + notarize path, so stable
ships the same source you tested with a clean version string. It then:

- publishes the `vX.Y.Z` stable release (marked latest) with the DMG, updater
  archive + signature, a regenerated `latest.json`, and a `stable-build.json`
  recording the source commit and asset SHA-256 values (so the Windows build
  reuses the same tree); the release stays draft until every asset verifies and
  those hashes are frozen in an immutable pre-publication workflow artifact;
- publishes the exact staged extension (or rechecks unchanged store state)
  immediately after the desktop release boundary;
- generates the changelog (first-parent commits since the previous `release: v...`)
  and embeds it in both the GitHub release notes and `latest.json`;
- updates the Homebrew tap and commits `release: vX.Y.Z` directly to `main`
  only after the extension step succeeds (the release bot is on the
  branch-protection bypass list), advancing the version files so the next RC's
  gate and the next changelog can anchor on it. The tap DMG must match immutable
  signing-job provenance. No PR to merge.

If publication succeeds but its job loses the response, rerun the failed
`publish-desktop` job in that same workflow run. It reuses the pre-publication
artifact and fails if any public release byte changed. Starting a new promotion
against an already-public version is deliberately rejected.

### 4. Cut the Windows release

The version bump lands on `main` automatically, so there is nothing to merge.
The Windows release rebuilds from the commit recorded in `stable-build.json`, so
it does not depend on the bump and can run as soon as promote finishes (see
`release-windows.md`).

## Release notifications

Stable releases are announced in Slack by the org's GitHub Slack app. Subscribe
the release announcements channel once with:

```text
/github subscribe open-software-network/os-june-releases releases
```

It posts when a `vX.Y.Z` stable release is published. RC builds reuse the fixed
`rc` release tag and are edited in place rather than re-published, so the
`rc-desktop-release` workflow posts each successful candidate through
`SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` after its release assets are available. The webhook message
links the source commit, that candidate's immutable versioned macOS DMG, and the
fixed `rc` release page. Delivery uses one bounded attempt and reports its result
in the Actions summary. It remains best effort and never turns a successfully
published candidate into a failed release run. If delivery is unconfirmed, check
Slack before posting manually; automatically retrying an incoming webhook could
duplicate an announcement when Slack accepted the request but its response was
lost.

The app polls:

```text
https://github.com/open-software-network/os-june-releases/releases/latest/download/latest.json
```

That endpoint is baked into shipped builds. Keep it alive until every install
that points at it has aged out or updated.

## Local fallback build

`scripts/build-signed-dmg.sh` remains as a fallback until a CI-built,
updater-delivered build passes Gatekeeper assessment and relaunches cleanly.
Use it only if the `tauri-action` path is blocked:

```sh
pnpm tauri:build:signed-dmg
```

Do not delete the fallback script until the first production updater release has
been installed over a previous updater-capable build and relaunched successfully.

## First updater release validation

After the workflow publishes a release, download the DMG from
`open-software-network/os-june-releases`, install the app into
`/Applications`, and run:

```sh
APP="/Applications/June.app"
DMG="$HOME/Downloads/June_universal.dmg"

codesign --verify --deep --strict --verbose=2 "$APP"
spctl --assess --type execute --verbose "$APP"
spctl --assess --type install --verbose "$DMG"
xcrun stapler validate "$APP"
xcrun stapler validate "$DMG"
plutil -extract CFBundleURLTypes xml1 -o - "$APP/Contents/Info.plist"
lipo -archs "$APP/Contents/MacOS/os-june"
lipo -archs "$APP/Contents/Resources/native/bin/June Dictation Helper.app/Contents/MacOS/june-dictation-helper"
lipo -archs "$APP/Contents/Resources/native/bin/June.app/Contents/MacOS/june-system-audio-recorder"
./scripts/audit-hermes-runtime.sh "$APP/Contents/Resources/native/hermes" --require-signed
/usr/bin/arch -arm64 "$APP/Contents/Resources/native/hermes/bin/hermes" --version
/usr/bin/arch -x86_64 "$APP/Contents/Resources/native/hermes/bin/hermes" --version
```

Confirm `osjune` appears in `CFBundleURLSchemes` and each `lipo` command
prints both `x86_64` and `arm64`. The Hermes audit must report native files for
both runtime trees, and both launcher commands must execute successfully. On an
Apple Silicon validation host, the x86_64 command is a real Rosetta execution,
not an architecture inferred from file metadata.

For the first updater-to-updater validation, install an older updater-capable
build, run **June -> Check for updates…**, confirm the prompt shows the
new version and release notes, install, and verify the app relaunches without
Gatekeeper warnings. Also confirm microphone and Accessibility permissions are
still granted after relaunch. During the relaunch, confirm the app remains
responsive after the command is accepted: the main event loop must return in
under one second while bounded child cleanup continues off-thread. For the
forced-leaf check, stop one tracked Hermes child with `kill -STOP <pid>` before
accepting the update and confirm June still relaunches after kill escalation or
the five-second aggregate deadline instead of showing a permanent beachball.

If any signing, notarization, updater signature, Gatekeeper, or relaunch check
fails, do not promote the release. Keep the fallback build path until the CI
path is proven with a real updater-delivered relaunch.
