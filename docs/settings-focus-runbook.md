# Settings focus mode — runbook

The settings tabs **introduced by this PR** (`feat/admin-surfaces`) are
temporarily hidden from the nav while we stabilize them one at a time. Every
**pre-PR** tab stays visible. Nothing is removed — the hidden tabs, their panels,
and their logic are all intact; only the nav entries are filtered out.

## What's visible vs hidden

Visible: the pre-PR tabs (**General, Billing, Shortcuts, Dictation, Audio,
Models, Agent, Installed skills, About**) plus **External skill directories**
(`external-dirs` is PR-new but verified working, so it's kept on) and **MCP
servers** (`mcp` — stabilized in JUN-137: add / test / toggle / edit / delete,
with a non-destructive connection-field edit).

Hidden (added by this PR, not yet stabilized):

| id | label |
|----|-------|
| `skill-review` | Pending skill changes |
| `mcp-catalog` | MCP catalog |
| `mcp-diagnostics` | MCP diagnostics |
| `mcp-security` | MCP security |
| `skills-hub` | Skills hub |
| `taps` | Team skill taps |
| `toolsets` | Toolsets |
| `bundles` | Bundles |
| `profile-builder` | Profile builder |
| `integrations-health` | Integrations health |
| `import-export` | Import / export |

This list was derived by diffing the `SettingsTab` union against `main`
(`git show origin/main:src/components/settings/AppSettings.tsx`).

## The single control point

`src/components/sidebar/Sidebar.tsx`:

```ts
export const HIDDEN_SETTINGS_TABS: ReadonlySet<SettingsTab> =
  new Set<SettingsTab>([
    "skill-review", "mcp", "mcp-catalog", "mcp-diagnostics", "mcp-security",
    "skills-hub", "taps", "toolsets", "bundles", "profile-builder",
    "integrations-health", "import-export",
  ]);
```

`SettingsSidebarNav` filters `SETTINGS_SIDEBAR_GROUPS` by this set (and keeps the
pre-PR billing rule: billing is hidden in local-dev). Empty groups drop out so
their headers don't render.

### Re-enable one tab (to work on it next session)
**Delete its id** from `HIDDEN_SETTINGS_TABS`. Example, to bring back MCP
security:

```ts
// remove "mcp-security" from the set
```

That restores the tab, its group header, and its panel.

### Restore the full nav (when the PR's surfaces are all stable)
Delete `HIDDEN_SETTINGS_TABS` and revert `SettingsSidebarNav`'s filter to the
original:

```ts
const groups = localDev
  ? SETTINGS_SIDEBAR_GROUPS.map((group) => ({
      ...group,
      items: group.items.filter((item) => item.id !== "billing"),
    })).filter((group) => group.items.length > 0)
  : SETTINGS_SIDEBAR_GROUPS;
```

## Status of the hidden surfaces (from the 2026-06-30 session)

| id | known status |
|----|--------------|
| `mcp` | shipped (JUN-137): unhidden; add / test / toggle / edit / delete verified. Edit is connection-field only (command/args/url) via a scoped, non-destructive `mcp_servers.<name>.<field>` config write; editing secrets/transport is a delete-and-re-add followup |
| `mcp-security` | works (config-write contract fixed) |
| `skills-hub` | search + loading fixed; install needs a GITHUB_TOKEN configured in June (Team skill taps), since the sandbox can't read the gh keyring |
| `taps` | hosts the GITHUB_TOKEN secret setup |
| `toolsets` | read-only inventory; works |
| `skill-review`, `mcp-catalog`, `mcp-diagnostics`, `bundles`, `profile-builder`, `integrations-health`, `import-export` | needs review |

## Caveat
Hidden tabs are removed from the **nav**, not made unreachable everywhere — a
direct `setSettingsTab("<hidden id>")` deep link still renders that panel. That's
fine; the goal is to declutter the nav, not hard-disable surfaces.
