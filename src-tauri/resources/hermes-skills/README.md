# Bundled Hermes skills

This directory contains June-bundled read-only Hermes skills that ship outside
the pinned Hermes runtime. June adds this directory to `skills.external_dirs` at
Hermes startup, after user-global `~/.agents/skills`.

Skill lookup precedence is:

1. `$HERMES_HOME/skills` for editable skills installed into the active Hermes
   profile.
2. User-global `~/.agents/skills`, for user or team skills shared across tools.
3. This bundled resource directory.

That order is deliberate: user-installed or profile-installed skills can shadow
June-bundled copies with the same name.

## unbroker

The current pinned Hermes runtime is `v2026.6.19`, and the latest tagged Hermes
release available when this was added (`v2026.7.1`) did not include `unbroker`.
Vendoring the skill keeps the runtime compatibility pin unchanged while making
the skill available in June.
