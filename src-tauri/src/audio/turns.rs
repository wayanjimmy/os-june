///    correlates highly no matter how quiet; the user's own voice does not
///    correlate no matter how loud the system source is.
/// 2. Cancellation depth (ambiguous similarity only): an adaptive canceller
///    learns the reverberant echo path and checks whether the microphone frame
///    collapses after removing the system reference.
/// 3. Level dominance (fallback, when the lag is trusted but the audio cannot
///    be scored): the system turn is clearly louder over the overlap. With no
