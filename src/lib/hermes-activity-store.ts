/**
 * Bounded, GLOBAL (cross-session) store of live agent activity — the data source
 * behind feature 11's Agent activity drawer.
 *
 * Where feature 04's `pendingActionStore` answers "what is blocked on me?", this
 * store answers the broader "what are my agents doing right now?": for each
 * session it keeps one rolled-up {@link AgentActivityRecord} — the phase
 * (running / waiting / background / error / complete), the tool in flight, how
 * many subagents are working, and when it last did anything. The drawer renders
 * these rows; it does not re-derive them from raw frames.
 *
 * Fed ONLY from the normalized {@link JuneHermesEvent} stream (the classifier's
 * output), never from raw gateway frames — raw JSON belongs to feature 15's
 * trace panel, not here. AgentWorkspace owns the single write path: it calls
 * `record(event, mode)` at the existing `classifyHermesEvent` site, exactly
 * where it already feeds the pending-action and unsupported stores.
 *
 * Pending-action counts are NOT counted here — they are the authority of feature
 * 04's store. The factory takes a `pendingCountFor(sessionId)` resolver (wired to
 * `pendingActionStore` in the singleton) so the two never drift and tests can
 * drive it directly.
 *
 * Framework-agnostic (no React) so tests drive it directly; AgentWorkspace adapts
 * it with a `useSyncExternalStore` wrapper, mirroring features 02/04/15.
 *
 * EXTENDING (downstream features): keep the per-session rollup shape.
 * - Feature 12 (subagent watch) SHIPPED: `subagentCount` is now backed by a
 *   `subagents: BackgroundHermesActivity[]` field, UPSERTED by `subagentId`/
 *   `handle` in {@link applyBackgroundActivity} and rendered as a "Background
 *   work" sub-list under the parent row in the drawer.
 * - Feature 14 (files touched / artifacts) adds an artifact timeline: add e.g.
 *   `artifacts: ...[]` here, fed from `tool` completions that write files, and
 *   render a drawer section. Keep the per-session rollup shape; do not add a
 *   second store.
