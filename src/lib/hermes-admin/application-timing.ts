/**
 * "When does this change actually take effect?" — the single most important
 * thing June must communicate about an admin mutation, and the source of a whole
 * class of perceived bugs when it is wrong (specs 02 and 21). A huge fraction of
 * confusion comes from changing a setting and expecting the LIVE agent to know
 * instantly when Hermes only applies it to the next session or after a gateway
 * restart.
 *
 * This module is the ONE place that maps each admin mutation to its application
 * timing and the user-facing copy for it. Every page reads from here so the
 * "applies next session / gateway restart required" language is identical across
 * Skills and MCP, per the spec's "all lifecycle copy is consistent" criterion.
 *
 * Copy follows June conventions: sentence case, no em/en-dashes.

 * - MCP test: IMMEDIATE (it is a probe, it changes nothing durable).
 * - env writes: GATEWAY RESTART (the runtime reads env at process start).
