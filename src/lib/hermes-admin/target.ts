/**
 * Who an admin request talks to. June can run TWO Hermes runtime processes at
 * once (sandboxed + unrestricted, see `hermes_bridge.rs`), and a profile/mode-
 * sensitive write (toggle a skill, add an MCP server, set an env value) MUST be
 * aimed at a chosen one — never "whichever connection happens to be first".
 * Implicitly targeting the first connection is the exact class of bug the chat
 * layer had: June mutates the wrong runtime and shows wrong state.
 *
 * A {@link HermesAdminTarget} is therefore a self-contained, explicit address:
 * base URL, auth token, the mode flags, the Hermes home, and the selected
 * profile id. The client is constructed from ONE target. To pick a target from
 * a bridge status, the caller uses a NAMED selector here
 * ({@link adminTargetForMode} / {@link adminTargetForCurrentMode}) so the choice
 * is visible in the code and reviewable, not buried in the transport.
