/**
 * Bounded, GLOBAL (cross-session) store of the files an agent has touched — the
 * data source behind feature 14's "Artifacts" timeline in the Agent activity
 * drawer.
 *
 * Where feature 11's {@link import("./hermes-activity-store")} answers "what is
 * each session doing right now?", this store answers "what files has each
 * session created, changed, read, downloaded, or failed to reach?". For each
 * session it keeps a bounded, newest-first list of {@link AgentArtifact} records
 * derived from `tool` completions; the drawer renders them and routes a click to
 * the app's existing file preview/download flow.
 *
 * Fed ONLY from the normalized {@link JuneHermesEvent} stream (the classifier's
 * output), never from raw gateway frames — raw JSON belongs to feature 15's
 * trace panel. AgentWorkspace owns the single write path: it calls
 * `record(event, mode)` at the existing `classifyHermesEvent` site, exactly
 * where it already feeds the activity, pending-action, and unsupported stores.
 *
 * Deliberately a SEPARATE store from feature 11's `AgentActivityRecord` (rather
 * than a field on it): feature 12 concurrently owns the activity record's
 * subagent deepening, so keeping artifacts in their own store avoids a collision
 * on that shape. The two stores share the same shape of API (factory +
 * singleton, `subscribe`/`getVersion`, total `record`) so AgentWorkspace adapts
 * both with the same `useSyncExternalStore` pattern.
 *
 * Extraction is CONSERVATIVE on purpose (see {@link artifactsFromToolEvent}): it
 * only reads a small set of known path/url fields off a tool-complete payload.
 * It never parses arbitrary prose (a command string, an output blob) for things
 * that look like paths — a false "the agent touched /etc/passwd" is worse than a
 * missed artifact.
 *
 * REUSE NOTE (feature 19 — structured image attachment): the {@link AgentArtifact}
 * shape is intentionally generic across file/image/directory/url so an attached
 * or edited image is representable here without a new type. Feature 19 can add an
 * `"attached"` action (see {@link ArtifactAction}) and feed this store from its
 * attach/edit flow the same way; the `kind: "image"` + `previewAvailable` fields
 * already carry what a thumbnail needs.
