/**
 * Hermes version compatibility matrix.
 *
 * A single, machine-readable, HONEST record of what June actually does with the
 * currently pinned Hermes runtime: which control-plane methods are wired into
 * UI, which classified events render, and which first-party feature surfaces
 * exist. It is the source of truth feature 20's upgrade checklist reads, and the
 * gate `isHermesFeatureSupported` consults.
 *
 * Honesty rules this matrix is held to (see the per-pack history in
 * `../README.md` and `docs/hermes-upstream-v2026.6.19.md`):
 * - `"supported"` means June BOTH understands the surface AND ships UI/flow that
 *   uses it today, with tests. Nothing aspirational.
 * - `"partial"` means the seam exists (e.g. the event is classified, or a
 *   generic settings surface exists) but the user-facing flow is incomplete.
 * - `"planned"` means feature 01 left a typed stub/classification but there is
 *   no UI at all yet; a later feature owns wiring it.
 * - `"unsupported"` means June deliberately does not handle it.
 * - `"unknown"` is reserved for queries about other versions or absent keys —
 *   the matrix entries themselves never use it.
 *
 * DOWNSTREAM FEATURES: when you ship your feature (add UI + tests that exercise
 * the method/event), flip your entry's `status` from `"planned"`/`"partial"` to
 * `"supported"` and update its `rationale` to point at the shipped surface. That
 * one-line change is all that is needed; keep the keys stable. The map of which
 * feature owns which keys is in `OWNERSHIP` below and in this module's tests.
 */
