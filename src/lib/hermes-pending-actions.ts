/**
 * Bounded, GLOBAL (cross-session) store of pending Hermes actions — the data
 * source behind feature 04's top-level "Needs you" tray.
 *
 * Hermes blocks the agent on four kinds of action until the user responds:
 * clarify, approval, sudo, secret (see `PendingHermesAction`). Each one is
 * surfaced inline in the session it belongs to (feature 03), but the inline
 * cards can't answer "what across ALL my sessions is waiting on me right now?".
 * This store is that aggregation: every `pending_action` event the gateway
 * classifies lands here, keyed by `mode + sessionId + requestId`, so the tray
 * can list one row per outstanding action and route a click to the right
 * session.
 *
 * Lifecycle (the careful part):
 * - An action is `open` when first seen and stays open until *confirmed*
 *   resolution: a matching response/the user responds (`resolveRequest`), the
 *   session completes or is interrupted or hits a terminal error
 *   (`resolveSession`).
 * - On a gateway reconnect we do NOT clear anything — a disconnect is not a
 *   resolution. Instead `reconcileAfterReconnect` marks still-unresolved actions
 *   `stale`: they remain visible (a stale-but-dismissable row beats a hidden
 *   blocker) but the tray renders them visually distinct. A fresh event for the
 *   same request after reconnect re-confirms it back to `open`.
 * - Resolution and expiration are sticky: once `resolved` or `expired`, a
 *   straggler duplicate of the same request can't resurrect the row.
 *
 * Framework-agnostic (no React) so tests drive it directly; AgentWorkspace
 * adapts it with a `useSyncExternalStore` wrapper, mirroring features 02/15.
 * Feature 11's activity drawer reads the same instance for its pending counts.
