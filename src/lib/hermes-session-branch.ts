/**
 * Session branching (fork from message) — the typed result feature 07 needs to
 * open the forked session, parsed defensively from the raw `session.branch`
 * result.
 *
 * The gateway's `methods.branchSession(...)` resolves to `unknown`: Hermes may
 * report the fork under different keys between pins (`new_session_id`,
 * `session_id`, a nested `session.id`), and the recorded fixture
 * (`hermes-control-plane/fixtures/branch.json`) carries `from_message_id` +
 * `new_session_id` + `title`. So this module owns the ONE place that turns that
 * raw blob into a {@link BranchSessionResult}.
 *
 * CONTRACT: the returned session id is AUTHORITATIVE — June opens whatever the
 * gateway minted and never invents a local id. A result that only echoes the
 * source session id is treated as "no fork happened" (`undefined`) rather than
 * silently re-selecting the source.
