 * tool use, and privacy (June's agent needs tool calling, and June's pitch
 * is zero-retention privacy, so every pick here is a "private" catalog model
 * that supports tools).
 *
 * Curation snapshot (June 2026), from the live Venice catalog plus public
 * benchmarks (SWE-bench agentic coding, Artificial Analysis intelligence
 * index):
 * - GLM 5.2: latest GLM flagship and June's default text model, with
 *   reasoning effort controls, tool use, 200K context, $1.75/$5.50 per 1M
 *   tokens.
 * - Kimi K2.6: leads the open-weights intelligence rankings, built for long
 *   agentic tool runs, 256K context, $0.85/$4.66.
 * - GLM 5.1: previous GLM flagship, top-tier agentic coding and tool use
 *   among open models, 200K context, $1.75/$5.50 per 1M tokens.
 * - Parakeet: fast, accurate everyday dictation at the lowest price tier.
 * - Whisper Large v3: best multilingual accuracy at the same low price.
 *
 * The default text model (DEFAULT_GENERATION_MODEL in the Rust providers
 * module, mirrored by the frontend and june-api defaults) is the first
 * generation pick here; keep them in sync when this changes.
 *
 * Ids are matched against the live catalog at render time, so a delisted
 * model silently drops out instead of rendering a dead row.

/**

 * read images AND run tools — a vision model without function calling would
 * brick the agent the same way the model picker guards against — so we filter
 * on both capabilities. Among the eligible models we prefer a curated
 * suggested pick (Kimi K2.6 is the suggested vision model), so the one-tap fix
 * lands on a sensible default instead of the alphabetically-first vision model
 * (which is otherwise arbitrary — the catalog sorts by display name). If no
 * suggested model is eligible we fall back to the first eligible catalog model
 * so a suggested-list change can never leave the fallback empty. The target is
 * derived entirely from live catalog capabilities: no model id is hardcoded,
 * so a retired model can never become the fallback.
